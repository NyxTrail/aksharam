## Downloading Data Files

When the app is first launched, you are given the option to download the data file for a
language of your choice. Later, if you decide to check out other languages, you can manage the
data files in the Settings screen.

## Letters Tab

In the letters tab of the app, you can choose the language you wish to learn from the "
Language" drop down. The app will now display all the characters of the selected language.
From the "Convert To" drop down, you can choose a language you know. Now, you can tap lightly
on a character to see what it looks like in the second language you chose (the one you know).
Tap longer (touch and hold) on a character to see more detailed information about that
character.

## Transliteration Tab

Here, you can copy in text in one of the languages for which you have downloaded data files
for and transliterate it into a different language of your choice. Note, the app tries to preserve
and use the corresponding letter of the second language where possible (even if the a letter is
pronounced different in that language). The idea here is to help the user recognise the letter in
the source script.

## Practice Tab

To use the practice tab effectively, it is recommended to install a keyboard that supports
at least two languages - one that you wish to learn and another that you know. I recommend the
"Indic Keyboard" by "Indic Project" available in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.smc.inputmethod.indic)
and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.smc.inputmethod.indic/).
In the practice tab, choose a script you wish to learn and a script that you know. Next you
can choose a suitable practice type and test your knowledge by entering characters in the script
that you already know.
